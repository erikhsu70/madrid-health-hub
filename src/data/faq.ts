        q: "What should I wear?",

        q: "Is the GLP-1 program right for everyone?",
        a: "No — and we say so when it isn't. Eligibility is decided by our physicians at intake based on your health profile and contraindications. Consultation first, prescription only if appropriate.",

        q: "Do you accept insurance?",
